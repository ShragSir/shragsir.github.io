### Gameplay

-   Simulation modes: Easy (beginner) and Normal
-   Stunt tracks having: jumps, loops, pipes or very twisted road
-   25 Vehicles:
    -   20 cars (Hyena or Fox are best for rally)
    -   few exotic with bigger wheels, or: 3, 6 and 8 wheeled
    -   other: 2 motorbikes, 3 hovering spaceships, 1 bouncy sphere

-   Dynamic objects on tracks (barrels, boxes, etc), can be hit

### Input

-   Game controllers support (gamepad, steering wheel, joystick etc.)
-   Input configuring (reassign keys, change sensitivity)

### Gui and HUD

-   Pacenotes - signs above road telling about:
    -   turns (and their difficulty), long turns (more white), terrain bumps,
    -   loops (few types), jumps (with required speed) and on pipe changes
-   Racing line (Trail)
    -   shows best way to drive, red colors for braking
-   Minimap, can be zoomed and rotated, terrain and border toggleable
-   Driving aids
    * arrow to next check point
    * next check point beam
    * track completion percentage
    * time difference and current points shown on each checkpoint
-   Detailed list of tracks with:
    * preview image and minimap (click to toggle zoom)
    * stats like: rating, difficulty, length, width, jumps, loops, pipes, obstacles and much more
    * driveability estimate for vehicle on track
-   Several gauge types (for engine rpm and vehicle speed)

### Graphics

-   8 Graphics presets for quick change to match hardware performance
-   Many graphics options to tweak each feature individually
-   Terrain triplanar mapping
