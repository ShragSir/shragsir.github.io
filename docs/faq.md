*Frequently Asked Questions.*

### General

**What PC do I need to play?**  
PCs with dedicated GPUs are best, check [Hardware Requirements](running)
for more details.

**Can I play on a laptop?**  
Some laptops that are recent or meant for gaming can handle the game.  
But older ones can't. Especially not laptops without a dedicated GPU.

**How to change camera view?**  
The default keys are C for next, X for previous. Hold shift for main
cameras only, there are many more without shift.

**What's the green car? What about the orange one?**  
This is nicely explained by in-game Hints which also are translated,
press Ctrl-F1 if you missed them.  
So, the green is the track's ghost (my ES drive for each track, drives
well and without mistakes).  
The orange one is your best drive ghost (by default). It will appear
after you drive a track. And will update after you drive it faster. You
can show/hide them on Replays tab and change their color on Car tab.

**Are there AI cars?**  
No. Some tracks are quite difficult to drive by human and I think AI
couldn't handle them well, surely not so good to compete with a human.  
It would be also difficult to code and test that (but not impossible, by
someone keen with this topic).

  
### Difficulty

**Why is it so difficult to drive?**  
Quite common question. This game is not an arcade style by design (but
it is not a difficult sim-racing either).  
Usually getting used to a new car simulation takes time and practice. It
is a part of the game.  
It may take weeks (or more) but in the end it is more rewarding to be
able to do it.  
This is especially true for people playing asphalt racing games before,
and never actually driving on gravel.  
And lastly, we don't believe it is difficult. In fact [Richard Burns
Rally](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Burns_Rally) is still more
complicated (and like any other game gets easy to play after time).  
It may be also possible that you are trying to play a game type that you
don't like. But I'd say trying other game types is good experience.

**How do I make the game easier to play?**  
We recommend first driving slower cars (like e.g. M3) on easy, flat
tracks.  
I don't recommend turning on ABS or TCS since those will in fact make it
harder to understand what is happening with tires (which ones spin or
slide) and thus make the game experience worse, weird or simply not as
it is meant to be. (there was a
[poll](https://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=81&t=5598) on forum
too)  
This may also happen when using different cars. The best car is ES. If
starting normal simulation mode, I highly recommend using this one as
first. It is easy to handle, fast and can drive on all tracks. Once you
learn it you can try others.  
If you're not a fan of cars, you can try the spaceships on some flat
tracks. They are very easy to handle and fun. Just don't try them in
pipes or other stunts, aren't drivable there.

**Why is it so easy to drive? How do I make the game harder to play?**  
It gets really easy once you know all tracks and get used to the
simulation. It's not yet on the level of difficulty I'd like to have.  
Try other cars. Some exotic cars are big, broad and different to
handle.  
We have a lot of challenges in game. Those are difficult to pass since a
good time is required on track and that usually with no mistakes. They
can be also driven with reversed tracks which double the count.

  
### Multiplayer

**Does it work?**  
Yes. But it only works with Direct Connect (need to know other IP).  
Master server (for games list) is not working since years.

**Why were there no servers/games in multiplayer list?**  
Check out this [Wiki page](multiplayer.md) about multiplayer and players
topic.

**Where can I find players to play multiplayer, Is there a lobby?**  
There is no lobby. Doesn't seem to be a way to find players since there
aren't many.  
I recommend playing with your friends.

**I can't connect, I get some error message.**  
This isn't a question, but see other common multiplayer issues and [FAQ
here](multiplayer#troubleshooting).

  
### Input

**Do I need a steering wheel to play it?**  
No. I assure you that this game is completely playable with keyboard. In
fact, all official game videos were (mostly from replays) driven with
keyboard.  
But surely you can take advantage of it. Force feedback isn't
implemented though.

**Can I play with a gamepad?**  
Sure. Check the section [Controllers](running.md#controllers) on how to
configure it. And setup it on Input tab.

**How do I reset my settings?**  
This is in our [Wiki Paths](paths.md), Just by deleting your config files.

**What's the difference between Space brake and Key Down ?**  
This is the same as in cars. Regular brake will act on all wheels (with
higher ratio on front). And it's best at slowing down car.  
The handbrake acts on rear wheels only and can also easily lock them to
make a faster car spin possible in sharp turns.

  
### OS

**Why is the game not in my Linux distribution?**  
We manage only the official binaries archive, which should be enough to
play the game on other distributions.  
But it may not work on some. There could be a problem with compiling it.
Or simply nobody yet did it.

**Why is there no OS X package?**  
Nobody managed to make it. And then continued to update it. If you still
want to play the game, I recommend trying it on Ubuntu.

  
### Contribute

**I have found a bug, what should I do?**  
If it is a crash than it's obvious but if not make sure it is a bug.
Observe if there is a pattern to have it happen, this will be useful in
fixing it.  
Read this wiki about [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md). It tells how to
report a bug and what is needed for it.

**How can I contribute to this project?**  
See page [Contributing](../Contributing.md)
and [wiki Contributing](contributing.md) for details and areas in which you
can contribute.  
Thank you for all contributions.

**How can I make a new track?**  
This needs some time to learn the editor but is well explained in a
series of [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL34F0C1D07445695F) and
also on [SR editor wiki](editor.md).

**Can I donate or support this project financially?**  
Yes. Since few years I (CryHam) started accepting donations. To donate use
[paypal link](https://paypal.me/cryham) or [CryHam donate page](https://cryham.tuxfamily.org/donate/).  
Thank you for donating. For now I didn't set up patreon yet.

**I have a question that is not answered here / how can I learn more about this project?**  
Firstly by reading the Wiki / Documentation. It describes most things already.  
Lastly, you can ask on Forum or IRC.  
For info about CryHam and the project there is a topic on forum with some very old
[interviews](https://forum.freegamedev.net/viewtopic.php?f=81&t=5974#p61415).
